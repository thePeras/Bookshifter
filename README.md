## Technologies

We scratched our idea in **Figma**, check the final designs at the design folder, and implemented everything in **Flutter**.
The books and their text recognition were made with the **Amazon Rekognition API** and all the book data was fetched from the **Google Books API**.

## How to run the project

To run the project, you need to have Flutter installed. If you don't have it installed, you can follow the instructions [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

After you have Flutter installed, you can clone the repository.

To use Rekognition API, create an access key by entering into your AWS account, search IAM and set up a new user. In the created user security credentials, create a new access key. Copy the access key and secret key and paste them .env file of app folder.

```bash
PUBLIC=your_access_key
SECRET=your_secret_key
```

Start the application by running the following commands in the project root directory:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
